# Crystal Community

This repo was created to allow users to post ideas about crystal libraries, but don't really know where to start.
It's also created to help developers find interesting projects to work on and help the crystal community the same time.

# How would it work?

If you have an idea for a shard, create an issue for it.  
Try to find people that are also interested on working on the library  
Once a developer has agreed to take on the project, they can request a repo under the crystal-community repository.  
If you want to develop your own library and add that to the crystal-community, you can just create an issue for it.  

# Rules

- All code must be properly licensed and free to use (MIT, BSD, etc.)
- The project must be useful to the community (This is debatable of course, but for example a command line nyan-cats shard is not really benificial to the community ;-))
- The project must have a maintainer, if a project can't find a maintainer anymore, this should be stated in the description.
